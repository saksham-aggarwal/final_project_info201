# Article Finder

The article finder tool allows for filtering of articles based on:
* Language
* Author
* Country

and displays relevant data about every article that fits the criteria. 

A current oddity that was discovered in creating this tool is that some articles have odd author names. It is most likely an issue with the BS Detector extension and scraping the wrong Strings for the author names.
